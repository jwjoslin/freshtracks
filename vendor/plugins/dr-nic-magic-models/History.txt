== TRUNK 2007-06-30

* Allows ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid for attempts to find pluralised tables that don't exist
* Refactored Rakefile into namespaces by database

== 0.9.2 / 2007-4-30

* 3 major bugfixes:
    * #generate_validations now works if you haven't already created a connection to the database; previously
			validations wouldn't get created until you had already established the connection; now it does it for 
			you if its not already established
		* Associations can be generated via the assignment methods, e.g. @membership.group= will generate the "belongs_to :group" association now. This allows the website tutorial to work correctly! Yay. That is, you can now do: Membership.create(:person => person, :group => group)
		* has_many's should work now

== 0.9.1 / 2007-4-11

* 1 minor enhancement:
    * ActiveRecord::Base includes all the magic model functionality via the MagicModel module
    * Existing ARs can get magic validation via #generate_validations call
    * Website tutorial works :D
